            Intro]
            Bruv, I don't wanna listen to her
            And she don't wanna listen to me
            Last week we're talkin' together forever
            This week, more fish in the sea
            Shit's just killin' me, G
            
            [Chorus]
            I had the perfect picture
            It was all laid out for me
            But I feel like I'm in love with the pain, fam
            'Cause it's the same old story
            Same old questions, what's your body count?
            Who were you linkin' before me?
            And I hope she don't ask me back
            'Cause my life like an episode of Maury
            
            [Verse 1]
            I've run out of excuses
            The truth is I'm so cold, I'm so frozen
            Too many times my heart has been broken
            And I can't even do the fake love, there ain't no pretendin'
            Thought that I found my partner-in-crime, my co-defendant
            But it's like watchin' a film and you already know the endin'
            See me, I think I think too much
            Try to keep it short and sweet but I say too much
            Now she wanna go back and forth, she wanna play two touch
            It's back to square one
            Both said things that shouldn't have been said
            Did things that shouldn't have been done
            Wish I could turn back time, man, I wish that I could get a rerun, 'cause...
            
            [Chorus]
            I had the perfect picture
            It was all laid out for me
            But I feel like I'm in love with the pain, fam
            'Cause it's the same old story
            Same old questions, what's your body count?
            Who were you linkin' before me?
            And I hope she don't ask me back
            'Cause my life like an episode of Maury
            I had the perfect picture
            It was all laid out for me
            But I feel like I'm in love with the pain, fam
            'Cause it's the same old story
            Same old questions, what's your body count?
            Who were you linkin' before me?
            And I hope she don't ask me back
            'Cause my life like an episode of Maury
            
            [Verse 2]
            Said she loved me 'cause I wasn't like the rest
            I rock and roll, I don't like the stress
            Now the friendship's based on how quick I reply to text
            She's talkin' reckless, I gotta bite my tongue
            Don't wanna say anything I might regret
            Died a thousand deaths
            Man, I wore so much Ed Hardy, how could I forget?
            That love kills slowly
            Still, everybody tryna do holy matrimony
            More time, one of them needs a trophy
            And the other one's scared to be lonely
            Every day another one falls off
            They link the wrong ting and got way too cosy
            Valentine's Day, it's all sweet and rosy
            Spend every other day just tryna score points like Kobe
            Nobody wants to lose but the winner gets nothin'
            Spent summer time stuntin'
            Then winter time comes, everybody starts cuffin'
            You know love takes time
            But relationship goals got everyone rushin'
            You get a feelin' it's way too good to be true
            So now you just tryna find somethin'
            Tryna find a reason
            Friends askin' me how I'm doin'
            I said, "Same shit, different season"
            My ex got a new boyfriend, I'm just tryna get even
            We don't hate each other, no, we just came to the end of the road
            She went one direction, I went the other
            Guess I gotta find me a new lover
            
            
            [Chorus]
            I had the perfect picture
            It was all laid out for me
            But I feel like I'm in love with the pain, fam
            'Cause it's the same old story
            Same old questions, what's your body count?
            Who were you linkin' before me?
            And I hope she don't ask me back
            'Cause my life like an episode of Maury
            I had the perfect picture
            It was all laid out for me
            But I feel like I'm in love with the pain, fam
            'Cause it's the same old story
            Same old questions, what's your body count?
            Who were you linkin' before me?
            And I hope she don't ask me back
            'Cause my life like an episode of Maury
