            Intro]
            (That's a good one, P)
            
            [Chorus]
            One-of-one bitches, they tens
            One of one, never again (One of one)
            Wun get the cake and the butter, I count it like hustle, the money all-in
            Ridin' around town in a drop-top coupe and the motor in the trunk, you can hear it (Skrrt)
            Think all about how they want me to lose, but I'm W, due for a win
            
            [Verse 1]
            Fuckin' this bitch in a orgy, I'm having a snow-bunny hold up her legs (Legs)
            Far from a dummy, I see how I'm coming
            Don't tempt me, I'm right on the edge (Don't tempt me)
            Gettin' it since a youngin, I been had the shoе box of money all under my bed (My bеd)
            2018, 'came a millionaire, made a career, niggas thought I'd be dead (Thought I'd be dead)
            I'm getting cold, my body cold, I took a lil' X (X, yeah)
            I hit her one time, told her pull up again, making that lil' pussy stretch
            Give me some head in the back of the Benz, grippin' the back of her neck (Woah, woah)
            I went and put mirror tint on the tint, I wanna see the reflection (Uh)
            I'm the best dressed at the Met (The Met)
            The wave in her dress, I know how to dress (I know how to dress)
            I turn the drip to a flex (Flex)
            I still got the check, I poke out my chest
            I'm treatin' that li'’ boy like my pets (Pets)
            I let the bitch use me for sex (Sex)
            I know that young Wunna a catch
            Got one of one ice on a jet (One of one)
            
            [Chorus]
            One-of-one bitches, they tens
            One of one, never again (One of one)
            Wun get the cake and the butter, I count it like hustle, the money all-in
            Ridin' around town in a drop-top coupe and the motor in the trunk, you can hear it (Skrrt)
            Think all about how they want me to lose, but I'm W, due for a win (W)
            
            [Verse 2]
            One of one, mixing it up (Mixing)
            One of one, mixing it in (In)
            One-of-one Mansory kit (Kit)
            Wunna wanna one of one bitch (Yeah)
            Come to the spot, I got all one of one pieces and all of 'em cost me a grip (Grip)
            Come to the 'yo, it's a pretty ho ready to go on a poke with her lips
            Good service, I'm ready to tip (Good service)
            You knowing I'm hip, I don't got a chip
            You know I ain't no lil' bitty shrimp (You know it)
            We switching positions, we switching locations, I'm fucking this bitch in the gym (Lift)
            She say she don't wanna say Gunna no more and she 'bout to start calling me Him ('Bout to start calling me Him)
            I'm him, hundreds, you making it hot (Hot)
            The stakes is high, the prices is high, I'm 'bout to fly to Dubai (I'm gone)
            Hoorsenbuhs, HB on the tie, I whip the one-of-one ride (One-of-one)
            Ain't cuffing the bitch, let her slide (Slide)
            I come in, I come to get mine (Mine)
            Pop out on these bitches like surprise (One of one)
            
            
            [Chorus]
            One-of-one bitches, they tens
            One of one, never again (One of one)
            Wun get the cake and the butter, I count it like hustle, the money all-in
            Ridin' around town in a drop-top coupe and the motor in the trunk, you can hear it (Skrrt)
            Think all about how they want me to lose, but I'm W, due for a win
