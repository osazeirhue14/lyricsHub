            [Intro: Abra Cadabra]
(Kico)
Oh, yeah, yeah (Ayy, Juggy, that's cold)
No problem, no problem
No problem, no problem
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 1: Abra Cadabra]
I'll be there when you need me most
I'll always be close, I'll never go ghost
You should know that you're fuckin' with a star man, yeah
Ain't nothin' new, I've been a star from years
And I'll take care of you because I'm normally paid
Leaving you nice and have you feeling a way, real hot stepper
Let me get a moment, let me praise you like a letter
Baby looking fire, defo hotter than the weather
I swear I'm really done with all these jezzies, man, I'm fed up
Tryna wake up right beside you in the morning when I get up
You're the only one impressing me
You're the only one I see next to me
You're the only one that interests me

[Chorus: Abra Cadabra]
I'll be there when you need me most (I'll be there)
I'll always be close (I'll always be close)
I'll never go ghost (I'll never go ghost)
You should know that you're fuckin' with a star man, yeah (Star man, star man)
Money no big problem to a star man, yeah (Star man, star man)
If you've ever got a problem, you can call on me (You can call on me)
Show you love every day 'cause that normal, yeah (Oh)

[Verse 2: Gabzy]
I'll be there when you need me most
I'll always be close, I'll never go ghost
Baby girl, you know you're messing with a star boy, yeah
Tell me when you need me, I'ma be right there
Take care of you, I'll give you more than you need
Baby girl got me comin' back like a fiend (Woah, woah, woah)
Anything you want, I'ma do it, my baby
See, them other girls can't phase me
Anything you want, I'ma do it, my lady
It's your loving, I need it daily
Anything you want, for you I do
You know I'll try, anything to make you smile
You know I got you for life, yeah

[Chorus: Abra Cadabra, Gabzy]
I'll be there when you need me most (I'll be there)
I'll always be close (I'll always be close)
I'll never go ghost (I'll never go ghost)
You should know that you're fuckin' with a star man, yeah (Star man, star man)
Money no big problem to a star man, yeah (Star man, star man)
If you've ever got a problem, you can call on me
Show you love every day 'cause that normal, yeah (Oh)
I'll be there when you need me most

Baby girl, you know you're messing with a star boy, yeah
Tell me when you need me, I'ma be right there
Take care of you, I'll give you more than you need
Baby girl got me comin' back like a fiend (Comin' back like a fiend)
