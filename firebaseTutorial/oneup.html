            [Intro]
            Uh, they think they got one up on us
            Don't trust bitches, out all my dargs, there's some I can trust (Huh)
            They think they got one up on us (That's what they think)
            Got PTSD, nearly done up a fan 'cause they ran up on us (Baow, baow, baow)
            (Lekaa Beats)
            
            [Verse 1]
            The fake do a good job blending in with the real these days, but I still tell the difference
            Realness get recognition, I recognised that from a distance
            See it from far (Wait)
            Bare ANPR, told bro, "Beg you don't smoke weed in the car" ('Low it)
            It feels good to see me in the charts, I used to hit shots, sell rock and link in parks (Alright)
            You've been warned, I'll ring the alarm
            They talk 'bout the trap, they ain't been in it once
            YG got the trench coat on, it's black and long like a Christian nun
            Tryna locate me a new plate, I don't put trust in vintage guns
            Stop winging and go get some money, what's wrong with these self-inflicted bums? (Alright)
            For my livelihood, push white in my hood, but I don't recommend it, there's no longevity
            "Central, don't forget me", money don't make me lose my memory
            A2 Anti, do man badly, do that gladly (Baow, baow, baow)
            I treat every day like a Monday mornin', I treat every month like a January
            
            [Chorus]
            Uh, they think they got one up on us
            D.T.B, I don't trust bitches
            Out all my dargs, there's some I can trust
            Won't even lie, I got PTSD
            Nearly done up a fan 'cause they ran up on us
            I left home when I was fourteen
            YJ was ten and the man of the house
            We go from babies straight to men
            
            [Verse 2]
            Get some money, relive your childhood
            Shawty think that I'm childish (Why?)
            Tryna pull down my trousers
            Rip man out of my Calvin's (Kleins)
            Out of sight, out of mind
            We ain't gotta jump out this ride
            Unwind the window, keep it simple
            Try hit man off his mountain bike
            Link up with the ganja farmer
            Cuttin' down plants, no agriculture
            Leave it to God, we don't practice obeah
            Plan it correct, we gon' catch him (Haha)
            I can't go broke, that's a no-no
            Can't fall off, that's awkward (Awks)
            My chain cost sixty thousand
            Cool, that's a club performance (Alright)
            I don't like braggin'
            I'm a lowlife but I like high fashion
            Amiri denim, it cost an arm and a leg and the jeans still saggin'
            Bro's still chinging, bro's still trapping
            Yinging and Yanging, I need more balance
            Baby, I just wanna fuck
            I'm sorry, I don't wanna meet your parents
            
            [Chorus]
            Uh, they think they got one up on us
            D.T.B, I don't trust bitches
            Out all my dargs, there's some I can trust
            Won't even lie, I got PTSD
            Nearly done up a fan 'cause they ran up on us
            I left home when I was fourteen
            YJ was ten and the man of the house
            We go from babies straight to men
            Uh, they think they got one up on us
            D.T.B, I don't trust bitches
            Out all my dargs, there's some I can trust
            Won't even lie, I got PTSD
            Nearly done up a fan 'cause they ran up on us
            I left home when I was fourteen
            YJ was ten and the man of the house
            We go from babies straight to men
