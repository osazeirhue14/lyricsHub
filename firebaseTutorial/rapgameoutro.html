            [Verse]
            Oi, Little B, remember when them niggas tried to shoot at my car but them niggas missed
            Free all my on-it opps 'cause them niggas missed
            Rest in peace NB, ’cause that nigga's missed
            YB too, I ain't forgot you, I got you on my ink
            Rest in peace Rick, we weren’t like that, but you showed me love
            Nothin' like them weirdo niggas, always switchin' up
            Rest in peace Kamari, I ain't seen you in a hundred months
            Before I rest in peace, I'm tryna give a hundred to my mum
            That's for all the times you ran up in my room and found some drugs
            And I had no excuse because I was tryna run it up
            The same niggas sayin' that it's war, I got them runnin’ off
            Used to look up to you, dumbest thing I’ve ever done
            Dumbest thing I've ever did
            You ain’t even sellin' bricks
            Really, I'm just sellin' packs, supporters wanna hear me rap
            Nanny used to lecture me often, "Stop sellin’ crack"
            I was in the traphouse when I heard she's never comin' back
            Most my paigons shook on their block, tryna see what's good
            And we ain't even ridin', we're just passin' through the neighbourhood
            And I won't squash beef with them, even if they say I should
            And I ain't goin' broke again, furthermore, I never could
            My mum knows I've got beef, be careful when you're on street
            Fine in the bando, then I'm probably up on Ox Street
            How you switch up on me when we used to roll deep?
            My flicky does lean, come like I dipped it in some Codeine
            Got a show, but my niggas dead
            This ain't how it's supposed to be
            From the age of four, five, my nigga used to roll with me
            To house parties every week, my nigga used to roll with me
            To slidin' on them opp boys, my nigga used to roll with me
            Got a wetter on me, and a hitter that still rolls with me
            My manager a savage, better watch how you're approachin' me
            A rack for this jacket, servin' shots without a racket
            Couple stacks for this hand thing, know yourself before I slap it
            My auntie don't like when I rap about gang shit, trap shit, bad shit
            She thinks I'm not a bad kid
            Bando bandit, my outfit cost about six
            I never used to have six, I never used to have racks
            I never used to sell B, I never used to have crack
            I never used to Christian Dior with a top to match
            I never used to have fake friends, well, nah, I did
            I never knew they were fake like frontal wigs
            Niggas doin' music, but they're rappin' shit they never did
            I'm always showin' prints, but I'm not cappin' when I rap my shit
            Don't know if this is where to say, but I wish I could trade my dead friends with certain niggas that are here today
            My bro finessed my other bro
            Now, they don't roll as friends
            I gotta go to the grave just to see my closest friend
            I write on my iPhone, I don't need a closest pen
            I got court tomorrow, pray that they don't send me to the closest penn'
            Got love for couple olders that I know, that's a shockin' fact
            None of them taught me how to cook coke or cock it back
            Used to hit shots out my yard like my mum comin' back
            Used to hit shots like there weren't such thing as the can
            Kiko told me, "Pattern up, you're movin' bait, you're movin' nuts"
            He's younger than me, but I learnt so much from him, it's fucked
            Blood don't mean nothin', loyalty, that's what's really up
            Blood makes you related, but I feel like I'm his mother's son
            I hate when feds come in my drum, tryna search for guns
            I know I failed all of my exams, but I'm not that dumb
            Tell them that I'm not the one, not number two, I'm number one
            Number one
